# Problems

## 01

Given an integer return the amount of digits it has.

## 02

Given a positive integer, return it reversed.

## 03

Check if an integer is a palindrome

## 04

Check if a number is prime.

## 05

Given a non-negative integer n followed by n other positive integers, return the number of primes among them

## 06

Given an integer, output all of its prime factors

**Example**: \
**Input**: \
24
**Output**: \
2 3

HINT: Can you skip the primality test?

## 07

Given a non-negative integer n, return the nth Fibonacci number

## 08

Given a non-negative integer n followed by n other numbers, check if the numbers form a monotonic sequence

## 09

Given a non-negative integer n followed by n other integers that form a sequence, find the length of the longest contiguous strictly increasing subsequence

## 10

Given an integer, output it as a product of prime numbers

**Example**: \
**Input**: \
24
**Output**: \
2 * 2 * 2 * 3

## 11

Given a non-negative integer n followed by n other integers, find the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subsequence.

**Example 1**: \
**Input**: \
8
-2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3
**Output**: \
7
**Explanation**: \
4 + (-1) + (-2) + 1 + 5 = 7
If we try to expand the sequence in either direction we will add negative numbers, thus reducing the sum.

**Example 2**: \
**Input**: \
3
-1 -4 -10
**Output**: \
0
**Explanation**: \
Every element is negative so we don't take any of them. (Sum of no elements is 0)

## 12

Given a positive integer and a number of iterations, approximate the square root of that integer using Newton's method.

## 13

Given a non-negative integer n followed by n integers, one of which appears more than the rest of the combined return that number.
